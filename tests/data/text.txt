Multivio: Project description Miguel Moreira June 15, 2010 1 Introduction Multivio is an Internet-based application for browsing and accessing digital doc- uments. It was originally motivated by the requirements of the digital library RERO DOC. However, it is meant to be open and adjustable in order to smoothly integrate with other document servers. It is also modular and extensible in order to cope with the continuous evolution of digital formats. The application is built in-house by RERO (the ”’Library Network of West- ern Switzerland”’) under an open-source license (to be defined), and integrates existing open-source software components. Its development is co-sponsored in the framework of the project ”’E-lib.ch: Swiss Electronic library”’ (see below). 2 Context In general, when users access the contents of digital libraries, they usually de- pendent on particular software tools installed in their computer system, suitable to each kind of content being accessed. These multiple tools offer a scattered view of the available content since they consider the digital files individually without taking into account logical relations between groups of files belonging to specific titles or collections. This situation implies a fracture between the phase when users search or navigate the object descriptions and the moment when they access the objects themselves. Indeed, the approach applied by most catalogues or document servers allow- ing access to digital content is to simply provide a hypertext link allowing the corresponding files to be downloaded. Then, on the user’s side, a suitable tool (that must be installed beforehand) allows the file to be viewed after download. This approach is relatively satisfying in certain contexts, particularly in the case of single volume monographs, for example in PDF format, given that the large majority of Internet users possess PDF-viewing software such as Adobe Reader or alike installed in his/her system. The same principle applies for other file types, each relying on a specific and adequate software tool. But it has lim- itations in the presence of documents of higher complex structure demanding navigation capabilities across several files, such as serials, collections, multivol- ume monographs and other aggregates. In addition, even in the case of plain, single-file documents the simple download option is not always the most ap- propriate, especially when the document has been found after a query operated by the user in a search engine, in which case the queried expression should be 1
